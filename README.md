# 📈 Sales Forecasting with Advertising Data  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **sales revenue** based on advertising spend across **TV, Radio, and Newspaper**. Using **Linear Regression**, the model analyzes how different media investments impact sales performance.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains:  
- **Features:** Advertising budgets for **TV, Radio, and Newspaper**  
- **Target Variable:** Sales revenue  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

## 🔍 Workflow  
✅ **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers.  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Used **heatmaps and pair plots** to examine correlations.  
✅ **Data Splitting:** Divided data into **training and testing sets**.  
✅ **Model Training:** Implemented **Linear Regression** for sales prediction.  
✅ **Performance Evaluation:** Measured accuracy using **MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score**.  
✅ **Visualization:** Compared actual vs. predicted sales using scatter plots.  

## 📈 Results  
- **Identified key advertising channels** influencing sales.  
- **Achieved accurate predictions** with Linear Regression.  
- **Improved model understanding** through visualization and evaluation.  

## 🚀 Key Learnings  
- Enhanced skills in **regression modeling, feature selection, and performance evaluation**.  
- Gained practical experience in **data visualization and predictive analytics**.  

## 🌟 Acknowledgment
