# Sales-Prediction
Built a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising budgets across TV, Radio, and Newspaper. Processed and analyzed the dataset, explored feature correlations, trained the model, and evaluated performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score. Visualized actual vs. predicted sales, enhancing my skills in regression and data analysis.
